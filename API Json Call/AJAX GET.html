  /* // STEP : 3
       # .onreadystatechange => is an builtin method in "XMLHttpRequest".it is an event handler that is triggered whenever the readyState property changes.
       # check the status of "request sending and receiving process"
       # this function has bulitin properties to check the state, status and responseText 
       # state as "readyState" : 0 to 4 steps
       # these states => used to check the process of sending and receiving  data. it should cross all the step one by one to compelete it's work
          READSTATE STEPS :
          0 => UNSENT -- XMLHttpRequest object has been created, but the open() method has not initilaized
          1 => OPENED -- open() method values has been declared(called), but the send() method has not used to access the valu
          2 => HEADERS_RECEIVED --  send() method is declared(called), and the request send to the specified api
          3 => LOADING -- server is on the process of sending api data to "responseText" property, not all data received partially recevied on process of getting
          4 => DONE -- "responseText" received all the data completely form the server
       # responseText => is an bultin property in  "XMLHttpRequest" this is an "string datatype"  
         Example : response: "{receive the response from server data in any format(json,xml,html) but when it received here it will be converted as string because this propery is an "string datatype"}"
         we have to convert the string data into usable object  by unsing  "JSON.parse(xhr.responseText)" and assign this converted data in another new variable
         Example :  const responseData = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
       # HTTP status code => is also an bultin property in  "XMLHttpRequest"
         403 : Forbidden =>  The server understood the client's request, but it refuses to authorize it, because client doesn't have the necessary permissions to access the requested resource.that is  they are not "logged in " to access the private dashboard.
         404 : Not Found =>  The server receives the request but cannot find the resource corresponding to the specified URL. when url is incorrect
         200 : OK => The server successfully finds the requested resource (like : home page) and is ready to respond.
